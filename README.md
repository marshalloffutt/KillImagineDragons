## KillImagineDragons :dragon:

A console app exploring Collections, and Linq methods. We define a class called `Song`, containing string properties of `Artist` and `Name`. We then define new lists named `goodSongs` and `allSongs` each that will hold instances of `Song`. We use Linq to filter the `allSongs` for songs where the artist is **not** Imagine Dragons. `goodSongs` is set to equal the filtered result.
